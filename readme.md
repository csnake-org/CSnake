CSnake
=======

CSnake is a build system based on [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). It is meant to simplify the configuration 
process of libraries. It was initially developed by the (ex)
Center for Computational Imaging & Simulation Technologies In Biomedicine (CISTIB), 
of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra ([UPF](http://www.upf.edu/)), based in Barcelona, Spain. 
It is mainly used to configure the building of the [GIMIAS](http://www.gimias.org/) software.

More information can be found on the [github page](https://github.com/csnake-org/CSnake).

Download the installer from the [releases](https://github.com/csnake-org/CSnake/releases) page.
