    <title>What is CSnake</title>

    <para>CSnake is a tool for C++ source code configuration. This means that
    CSnake can be used to create libraries and executables out of C++ source
    code. For this purpose, CSnake allows you to:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>define libraries and executables</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>specify which source files should be incorporated into a library
        or executable</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>specify paths where the compiler should search for include
        files</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>define dependencies between different libraries and executables
        (automatically handling the paths where include files from the
        dependent projects should be searched).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>include <emphasis>config-files</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>use-files</emphasis> from CMake. This is possible because
        <emphasis role="bold">CSnake is internally using
        CMake</emphasis>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The output of CSnake is a set of CMake files. In most cases, you
    will not be aware of this, because you will use CSnakeGUI to produce a set
    of Visual Studio files (on Windows) or KDevelop files that you can
    directly use to build your applications and libraries.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The name CSnake derives from the Python programming language (as
      CSnake is written in Python) and CMake.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Installing CSnake</title>

    <para>Copy the contents of
    \\193.145.44.5\standard_software_installers\WindowsXP\GIMIAS\Other\CSnake
    to your Program Files folder. You can start CSnakeGUI by double clicking
    on CSnakeGUI.bat. Before experimenting with CSnakeGUI, we advise you to
    read the next chapter on creating a CSnake project.</para>

    <important>
      <para>In this user guide, we will assume that CSnake is installed in
      C:\Program Files\CSnake. If you install CSnake to a different folder
      (for example on Linux), use this folder in the examples to
      follow.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>How to create a CSnake project</title>

    <para>When you want to create a library (or executable) out of your source
    code, you need to create a CSnake project for that library. This is done
    by instantiating a Python class called csnBuild.Project. The following
    Python file contains an example:</para>

    <example>
      <title>CSnake example: csnMyLibrary.py</title>

      <para><programlisting format="linespecific" id="python" lang="python"
      linenumbering="numbered">import csnBuild
myLibrary = csnBuild.Project("MyLibrary", "library")
myLibrary.AddSources(["src/MyLibrary.cpp", "src/MyLibrary.h"])
myLibrary.AddIncludeFolders(["src"])</programlisting></para>

      <para>This small Python program is sufficient to create your first
      library using CSnake. We will step through it line by line. Line 2 tells
      the Python interpreter to create a new csnBuild.Project for building a
      library with the name MyLibrary. The result is stored in the variable
      myLibrary. In line 3, you add a list of source files to your library:
      myLibrary.cpp and myLibrary.h. The square brackets [ ] are used to
      indicate the beginning and ending of the list. In line 4, a list of
      include folders (containing only the folder called 'src') is added to
      the library project.</para>
    </example>

    <note>
      <para>This Python program only contains the specification of your
      library. You will use CSnakeGUI to generate the Visual Studio files (or
      KDevelop files) that can be used to build the library.</para>
    </note>

  <chapter>
    <title>Generating a CSnake project using Python</title>

    <note>
      <para>This chapter explains how to generate a CSnake project (i.e.
      produce Visual Studio files) using the Python interpreter instead of
      CSnakeGUI. It may provide some more insight how CSnake works, but can be
      skipped by users who only want to use CSnakeGUI.</para>
    </note>

    <para>To generate the CSnake output for our myLibrary project, add the
    following lines to csnMyLibrary.py (or load the existing file in the
    examples/MyLibrary subfolder of CSnake)</para>

    <programlisting>if __name__ == "__main__":
    generator = csnBuild.Generator()
    generator.Generate(myLibrary, "./bin", "./install")</programlisting>

    <para>These lines create a csnBuild.Generator, which is used to generate
    CMake files for myLibrary. Now open a prompt in the folder holding
    csnMyLibrary.py. We will use the PYTHONPATH variable to ensure that
    csnBuild can be found by the interpreter (adjust the path below as
    necessary), and then run CSnake</para>

    <programlisting>&gt;set PYTHONPATH="C:\Program Files\CSnake\src"
&gt;python csnMyLibrary.py</programlisting>

    <para>After running this, CMake files have been placed in the folder
    "./bin/libraries/MyLibrary" (a subfolder in the current path). You can now
    use CMake and then Visual Studio to build your library. By building the
    INSTALL project in Visual Studio, the library will be copied to the folder
    "./install".</para>

    <note>
      <para>In general, it is not necessary to build the INSTALL project for
      an application that is created with CSnake. Instead, you can directly
      run the application from the bin folder.</para>
    </note>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>Generating a CSnake project using CSnakeGUI</title>

    <para>In this chapter we will use CSnakeGUI to produce the VIsual Studio
    (or KDevelop) files for building myLibrary. Double click CSnakeGUI.bat and
    set up the screen as below.</para>

    <example>
      <title>CSnakeGUI screenshot: building myLibrary</title>

      <graphic fileref="http://cilab2.upf.edu/~ftpcistibuser/CSnake/Images/MyLibrary.png"
               format="PNG" />

      <para>The Project Path is the location of the Python file we created in
      the previous chapters. In the Instance field, you should enter the name
      of the variable that is holding the target project that you wish to
      build. Finally, the Bin Folder is the location where the Visual Studio
      files as well as the binary project files (the output of the compiler
      and linker) are placed. Ensure that the option 'Create CMake files and
      run CMake' is selected and press 'Do --&gt;' to run CSnake. When you
      browse to the Bin Folder in your file manager, you will see a subfolder
      'library/MyLibrary' that contains the solution file (on Windows) or
      KDevelop file (on Linux) for building MyLibrary.</para>
    </example>

    <para></para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>Adding dependency projects</title>

    <para>In most cases, your project will depend on other projects. Let's
    assume that MyLibrary needs another library called MyDll:</para>

    <programlisting format="linespecific" id="python" lang="python"
                    linenumbering="numbered">import csnBuild
import csnUtility

myDll = csnBuild.Project("MyDll", "dll")
myDll.AddSources([csnUtility.GetDummyCppFilename()])

myLibrary = csnBuild.Project("MyLibrary", "library")
myLibrary.AddSources(["src/MyLibrary.cpp", "src/MyLibrary.h"])
myLibrary.AddIncludeFolders(["src"])
myLibrary.AddProjects([myDll])</programlisting>

    <para>Since we only introduced the new project myDll for educational
    purposes, it does not need to contain any useful C++ code. Instead of
    adding some existing source files to myDll, we choose to use a built-in
    CSnake feature: the <emphasis role="bold">dummy cpp file</emphasis>. This
    source file can be added to any project to prevent the project from having
    no source files. The path to the dummy cpp file is obtained by calling
    csnUtility.GetDummyCppFilename(). In the last line of the example, myDll
    was added as a dependency project of myLibrary. This means that myLib will
    link myDll, and is able to locate and use any of its include files.</para>

    <note>
      <para>A CSnake project that has no source file cannot be generated.
      Trying to do so will result in an error.. </para>
    </note>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>Building the CISTIB third party libraries</title>

    <para>The CISTIB toolkit comes with many libraries that can be used as
    dependency projects. Most of the projects in the CISTIB toolkit rely on
    third party libraries. Therefore, the first step in building the CISTIB
    toolkit is to build the third party libraries.</para>

    <para>ADD SOME STUFF ABOUT BUILDING THE TOOLKIT HERE...</para>

    <para>Now that the CISTIB toolkit has been built, let's go back to the
    myLibrary example and use itk as a dependency project:</para>

    <programlisting format="linespecific" id="python" lang="python"
                    linenumbering="numbered">import csnBuild
import csnCISTIBToolkit

myLibrary = csnBuild.Project("MyLibrary", "library")
myLibrary.AddSources(["src/MyLibrary.cpp", "src/MyLibrary.h"])
myLibrary.AddIncludeFolders(["src"])

itk = csnCISTIBToolkit.itk()
myLibrary.AddProjects([itk])</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>The following examples make use of csnCISTIBToolkit, which we
      assume to be located in E:\Code\Toolkit</para>
    </note>

    <para>The csnCISTIBToolkit Python file serves as a directory of available
    CSnake projects. For each project in the CISTIB toolkit, it has a function
    that returns the unique instance of that project. In the above example, we
    use the itk() function (note that if you call the itk() function again,
    the same itk project instance will be returned). To use csnCISTIBToolkit
    in CSnakeGUI, use the Add button to add the <emphasis>root folder
    </emphasis>where csnCISTIBToolkit.py can be found (in this example, the
    location is E:\Code\Toolkit):</para>

    <graphic fileref="http://cilab2.upf.edu/~ftpcistibuser/CSnake/Images/MyLibraryAndEvoLib.png"
             format="PNG" />

    <important>
      <para>The Add and Remove button in CSnakeGUI can be used to specify
      <emphasis>root folders</emphasis>. CSnakeGUI will add these root folders
      to the system path of Python, so that they are used when an
      <emphasis>import </emphasis>statement is encountered in the Python code.
      You can also use the import statement with a subfolder of a root folder,
      but in that case every node in the subfolder path must contain a file
      called __init__.py (see <link
      linkend="???">http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pytut/Packages.html</link>).</para>
